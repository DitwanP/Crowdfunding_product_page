# Frontend Mentor Crowdfunding Product Page Practice

This was a simple page that was built to continue practicing Html and CSS. The design is from Frontend Mentor, a site that I found that provides challenges in the form of web pages that you must try to recreate from scratch. I changed the design a little to be darker and also changed the primary color to something I though would be more fitting with the darker background.
